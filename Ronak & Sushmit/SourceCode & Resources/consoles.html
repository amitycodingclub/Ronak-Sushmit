		<font size=5><p>Gaming has evolved a lot over the years. With the advent of Playstations and Xbox systems, many of us have moved on from the devices of the past. Gone are days when you had to spend an hour plugging in a gazillion display ports to hook up your SNES to your Television. No more do we hear the classic 8bit theme song that played with games like Mario, Contra. What we do have today is amazing. Yes. But if it wasn’t for these classic consoles, we wouldn’t have the consoles of the modern era.<br>
		Here’s a look at some of the most revolutionary retro gaming consoles :
		</p></font>
		<h1><font face='comic sans ms'>Sega Dreamcast (1999)</font></h1><br>
		<img src="images\consoles\sega_dreamcast.jpg">
		<font size=5><p>Sega's swan song in the console world, the short-lived Dreamcast was ahead of its time. In 1999, the small, white box launched as Sega's sixth console generation, delivering online play and crisp 3D graphics before the Sony PS2, Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo GameCube entered the market. Dreamcast controllers have their own screens with the system's unique VMU memory cards, allowing you to play mini games or gain a tactical advantage. And when it comes to fun, classics like "Shenmue," "Crazy Taxi" and "Sonic Adventure" are still just as enjoyable today.</p></font>

		<h1><font face='comic sans ms'>Super Nintendo (1991)</font></h1>
		<img src="images\consoles\super_nintendo.jpg">

		<p>While Nintendo's new Wii U console is known for its unique controller and motion-sensing capability, the Super Nintendo is known for one thing: games. This 16-bit powerhouse is responsible for shaping the tastes of many '90s gamers, whether they preferred exploring dungeons in "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past" or soaring through space in "Star Fox." And while you can play "Mario Kart" on just about any Nintendo system, there's something special about cruising down the tastefully pixelated Rainbow Road in its original incarnation.

		</p><br>
		<h1><font face='comic sans ms'>Sega Saturn (1995)</font></h1>
		<img src="images\consoles\sega_saturn.jpg">
		<p>The Sega Saturn was ultimately eclipsed by the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64 in the states, but that doesn't mean it didn't leave a legacy of great games. This 32-bit powerhouse made way for well-loved adventure romps like "Guardian Heroes" and "Panzer Dragoon," and had arcade-perfect ports of quarter-suckers like "Virtua Cop" and "Virtua Fighter 2." Sega currently makes games for just about every platform out there, but many of the company's highlights are on the Saturn.</p><br>

		<h1><font face='comic sans ms'>Nintendo GameBoy Advance(2001)</font></h1>
		<img src="images\consoles\nintendo_gameboy_advance.jpg">
		<p>While Nintendo's flagship Game Boy console started as a blocky, white box in 1989, the Game Boy Advance evolved the machine to sleek perfection in 2001. This 32-bit handheld device hosted legendary role-playing games (RPGs) like "Golden Sun" and "Fire Emblem," and evolved classic Nintendo franchises with "Metroid Fusion" and "Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire." This pocket-size console plays Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance titles, so consider it your gateway into a good chunk of Nintendo's handheld history.</p>
