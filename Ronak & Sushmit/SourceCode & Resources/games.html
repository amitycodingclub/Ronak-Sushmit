			<font size=5><p>Games, like all art, are a product of the era in which they were created. So with that in mind, we put less emphasis on whether decades-old games can “hold up” against the modern AAA greats, and placed more importance on how incredible that gaming experience felt in its own era. After all, which is a greater achievement — a game that breaks significant new ground and feels a decade ahead of its time, or a game that comes out a generation later and finally manages to make some small improvements to the formula?
			So here are some of the oldest, yet most revolutionary games of all time:

			<h1><font face='comic sans ms'>Tetris (Nintendo Gameboy, 1989)</font></h1>
			<img src="images\games\tetris.jpg" height="364" width="480">
			<p>It’s odd to think that a game centring on finding the best way to successfully arrange a group of coloured blocks should have been at its best when played on a machine that was incapable of displaying more than four shades of greenish-grey. But, regardless, the Game Boy version of Alexei Pajitnov’s opus was simply the perfect match between game and hardware.</p>
			<br>

			<h1><font face='comic sans ms'>Super Mario Kart(SNES, 1992)</font></h1>
			<img src="images\games\super_mario_cart.jpg" height="364" width="480">
			<p>While everyone has their favourite Mario Kart – from the four-player-thrills of Mario Kart 64 to the weaponised mayhem of Double Dash!! – few would deny the SNES game’s claim to top spot. It’s aged beautifully – and, unlike many of its successors, every victory is hard-earned. Gaming’s finest spin-off.</p><br>
			<h1><font face='comic sans ms'>Donkey Kong(Arcade, 1981)</font></h1>
			<img src="images\games\donkey_kong.jpg" height="364" width="480">

			<p>The game that launched the career of a certain plumber, Nintendo’s 1981 arcade hit was pivotal. Having failed to crack the US, president Hiroshi Yamauchi convinced young designer Shigeru Miyamoto to create a new game. Jumpman (renamed Mario, after the US arm’s landlord, for the game’s Stateside launch) and his simian nemesis gobbled enough quarters to keep Nintendo afloat and launch countless Kong spinoffs (pictured). The rest is history.</p><br>
			<h1><font face='comic sans ms'>Duck Hunt (NES, 1984)</font></h1>
			<img src="images\games\duck_hunt.jpg" height="364" width="480">
			<p>A precursor to the modern first-person shooter, Duck Hunt didn’t allow you to blast zombies, mutants or even mutant zombies. But lowering the waterfowl population was just as satisfying. Perhaps it was the bundled NES Zapper – one of the finest lightguns we’ve wielded. Or maybe it was the chance to wipe the smirk off of that dog’s face.</p><br></font>
